        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            <span>The inspiration behind</span> my creation stemmed from a profound passion for game development,
            fueled by an enduring belief in the inherent joy it brings. Eager to explore uncharted
            territories and acquire new skills, I embarked on the exhilarating journey of crafting
            "Skywar." This endeavor not only brought me immense satisfaction but also enriched my
            creative spirit as I continually honed my craft through the process of refining and
            updating the game.
